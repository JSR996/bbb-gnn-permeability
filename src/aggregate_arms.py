"""Does a Pareto reduction beat the linear one? linear vs nsga2 vs composite.

The reward R = w_D*D + w_C*C + w_Q*QED + w_S*SA is a Minkowski-weighted
linear scalarization, so Theorem 1 of Das & Dennis (1997) applies: no choice
of weights reaches a Pareto-optimal candidate inside a concave fold of the
frontier. Measured on this project's own sampled groups, a linear reduction
reaches **0.48** of the per-group Pareto front over 2000 random weightings,
and the four objectives are nearly uncorrelated (mean pairwise +0.009, D vs C
= -0.258) -- the regime where a rank-based reduction has the most to find.
`src/pareto.py` has the derivation and a runnable concave-fold demo.

All three arms share the four seeds and the per-seed warm starts, so the
comparison is paired on both. That matters more than it sounds: warm-start
variance is ~2x GRPO-seed variance here, and pairing on only the seed is what
made the VAE comparison read as a clean regression when it was noise.

A metrics table cannot tell "better" from "Goodharting differently", so the
report ends with the two off-instrument checks:

  * D_real -- the discriminator's score on real BBBP+ drugs is 0.94 while it
    gives the generator 0.80 in every configuration tried so far. Closing
    that is the realism question.
  * the INSTRUMENT GAP, C(BBBP) - C(B3DB): the training ensemble minus a
    judge it never saw. Real drugs sit at -0.029. A gap that grows means the
    arm found more of the selector's blind spots, not better molecules -- so
    an arm may "win" on c_mean and still be the worse arm.

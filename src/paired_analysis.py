"""Paired-seed comparison of model architectures.

The seed in this project controls the *split* (see src/split.py), and every
model is trained on the same seed-s split. So the architecture comparison is a
paired design, and reporting it with marginal (across-seed) standard
deviations overstates the noise: most of that spread is split difficulty,
which is common to all models on that seed and cancels in a per-seed
difference.

Concretely on BBBP, base-GNN marginal SDs run up to 0.045 while the gaps
between operators are ~0.013 -- which reads as hopeless. The paired SD for
gat-gin is 0.009, so the same gap is a ~1.4 sd effect. The comparison was
always better powered than the marginal numbers suggested.

This script verifies the pairing assumption before relying on it, rather than
inferring it from the code: within each (dataset, seed) every model must have
been scored on a test set of the same size AND the same positive count. A
source that fails that check is reported and excluded rather than silently
pooled.

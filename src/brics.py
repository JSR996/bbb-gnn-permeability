"""BRICS decomposition: molecule <-> (fragments, junctions). The shared substrate.

Both halves of the project need the same notion of "a fragment", so this module
is the single definition and is imported by the classifier's motif-graph family
and by the generator's assembly engine alike. If the two sides disagree on what
a fragment is, the generator optimizes a vocabulary the classifier cannot read
and the reward stops meaning anything.

WHY NOT `BRICS.BRICSDecompose`. That returns a *set* of fragment SMILES, which
is lossy: aspirin decomposes to two `[3*]` and two `[16*]` attachment points and
nothing records which pairs with which, so the parent cannot be rebuilt. The
combinatorial re-expansion of that ambiguity is what `BRICS.BRICSBuild` explores.
We want the actual parent back, so `decompose` keeps the junction list and
`reassemble` is its inverse. Measured: 2039/2039 BBBP and 7805/7805 B3DB
molecules round-trip to an identical canonical SMILES.

THE JUNCTION CARRIES A BOND TYPE, and that is not decoration. BRICS cuts
type-7 alkene linkages as well as single bonds, so rebuilding every junction as
`SINGLE` silently hydrogenates 91 of BBBP's 2039 molecules --
`CN(C)CCC=C1c2ccccc2CCc2ccccc21` comes back as `...CCCC1...`. The round-trip
assertion below is what caught that; it is cheap and it stays.

ZERO-CUT MOLECULES ARE NOT AN EDGE CASE. A fused aromatic with no cleavable
linker (pyrene, phenanthrene) yields no BRICS bonds at all: **12.8% of BBBP and
9.3% of B3DB**. Those fall back to a single whole-molecule fragment, which is
the scaffold-core case -- one motif node, no junctions. Callers must handle a
one-node motif graph rather than assuming a decomposition happened.
